## The project
With this project I hope to perform various operations:
- Transform an image of a labyrinth into a matrix.
- Implement various labyrinth resolution algorithms.
- Paint an image of a new maze with the solution path.

For now the project is funtional, but i need to refactor a lot of things and comment a lot of code.

It has several freatures that I'm going to re-implement, like the image translation to a maze: currently the 
labyrinth is represented lying down (x and y inverted) and I want to modify this behavior in future versions.

Several parts of the architecture are going to change too.
